                    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                    <p1>
                        My name is Porter. I am a prospective 
                        computer science major at Earlham College.

                    <h2>General Background</h2>
                    <p1>
                        I have been interested 
                        in computer science since Middle school. 
                        I was homeschooled until Sophomore year 
                        of highschool, and I had the opportunity 
                        to pursue the subjects that were most 
                        interesting to me. During the rest of 
                        highschool I was able to continue 
                        learning about computers and programming 
                        through the dual-credit program at Berea 
                        College.

                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <h3><i>Computer Science</i></h3>
                    <p1>
                        Computer science will always be what I 
                        associate myself most with. As a hobby, 
                        computer science was a way for me to keep 
                        my brain active, almost like a crossword puzzle. 
                        I like having problems to solve, things to 
                        reason through. Computer Science continues 
                        to be the best outlet for this energy.
                    </p1>
                    <h3><i>Music</i></h3>
                    <p1>
                        Second to computer science, music is 
                        probably the biggest part of my life. 
                        I love listening to music, as well as 
                        playing piano. 
                    </p1>
                    <h3><i>Art</i></h3>
                    <p1>
                        Art is by no means a career option for 
                        me, but I try to keep myself active 
                        for the sake of maintaining creative 
                        flow and having an understanding of 
                        art and design concepts.
