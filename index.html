                    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                    <p1>
                        My name is Porter. I am a prospective
                        computer science major at Earlham College.

                    <h2>General Background</h2>
                    <p1>
                        I have been interested
                        in computer science since Middle school.
                        I was homeschooled until Sophomore year
                        of highschool, and I had the opportunity
                        to pursue the subjects that were most
                        interesting to me. During the rest of
                        highschool I was able to continue
                        learning about computers and programming
                        through the dual-credit program at Berea
                        College.

                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                    <h3><i>Computer Science</i></h3>
                    <p1>
                        Computer science will always be what I
                        associate myself most with. As a hobby,
                        computer science was a way for me to keep
                        my brain active, almost like a crossword puzzle.
                        I like having problems to solve, things to
                        reason through. Computer Science continues
                        to be the best outlet for this energy.
                    </p1>
                    <h3><i>Music</i></h3>
                    <p1>
                        Second to computer science, music is
                        probably the biggest part of my life.

                    </p1>
                    <h3><i>Art</i></h3>
                    <p1>
                        Art is by no means a career option for
                        me, but I try to keep myself active
                        for the sake of maintaining creative
                        flow and having an understanding of
                        art and design concepts.
