                    <p1>
                        My name is Porter. I am a prospective 
                        computer science major at Earlham College.

                    <h2>General Background</h2>
                    <p1>
                        I have been interested 
                        in computer science since Middle school. 
                        I was homeschooled until Sophomore year 
                        of highschool, and I had the opportunity 
                        to pursue the subjects that were most 
                        interesting to me. During the rest of 
                        highschool I was able to continue 
                        learning about computers and programming 
                        through the dual-credit program at Berea 
                        College.
